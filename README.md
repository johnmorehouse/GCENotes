# gcs-rstudio-guide

This folder contains a short guide on how to integrate Google Cloud Storage with an Rstudio GCE instance (intended for people with very little background in cloud computing, like myself). This is a direct extension of what I learned in [Grant McDermott](http://grantmcdermott.com/) class, and I strongly suggest you head over to [his notes](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/14-gce/14-gce.html#requirements) for a more in depth look at the basics of cloud computing. 

The notes are in html format and can be found [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/johnmorehouse/gcs-rstudio-guide/5053ab70a9dad0173069ec9a00de654e8c55cb00/gce_notes/gce_notes.html).

Suggestions are always welcome.
